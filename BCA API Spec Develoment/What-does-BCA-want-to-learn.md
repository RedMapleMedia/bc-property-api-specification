# What does BCA want to learn? #

Through this collaboration, BCA wants to understand the business and technical needs of potential API service. This includes:



- What are the potential uses cases for an API service?
- What technical features should the API have: i.e. how should the API work?
- What are the potential business models for API service customers (e.g., subscription, freemium, pay as you go)?
