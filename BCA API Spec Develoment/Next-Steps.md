# Next Steps

Read on for next steps and see the [Development Map.](Development-Map.md) 

##Iterate on the Swagger Definition
Developers are invited to fork the repo, edit the Swagger file, and to send us their changes in a pull request.
 
The project technical team will review pull requests and merge them into branches. The community can then provide input through GitHub on what they like, before any changes are merged into the master branch.

The more iteration based upon community feedback the better.
 
If fork and pull request sound foreign, we are referencing the GitHub workflow. You can learn more about [GitHub here](https://help.github.com/).

##Prototype
Once enough progress is made we will publish a prototype of the API to test how the Swagger translates into code.
 
We think we likely use StrongLoop to take us from Swagger to a bare bones API.

Developers will then be invited to fork the API code and to send us their changes in a pull request.

Once again, the technical team will review and merge what they like into branches and invite the community to weigh in.

##Questions
Have technical questions? [Post an issue](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/bc-property-api-specification/issues) in the GitHub repo and the technical team will get back to you as soon as possible.
