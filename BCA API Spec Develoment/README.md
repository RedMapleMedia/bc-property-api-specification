# What is this about? #As part of its commitment to making property data more accessible BC Assessment (BCA) is exploring the potential of developing a new Application Programming Interface (API).
  
BCA invites you to help develop an API to serve the B.C. property market. This is an opportunity to collaborate in GitHub on the open development of an API specification.  This API would provide authenticated machine-to-machine access to BCA’s property data.
 
BCA is committed to developing a service that is valued by the market and that can be supported by a viable business model. Charging for such an API will be important for a viable business model. However, what that charge is, and how it is structured, is part of the conversation we want to have with you.

This engagement is about customer discovery. Developing the API in the open on GitHub is an opportunity for BCA to understand the needs of potential customers of this service and to ensure that we are meeting the business and technology needs of the market.

The open development of the API spec will be facilitated by the BC Developers’ Exchange (BCDevExchange), an initiative led by the Government of B.C. to encourage partnerships and opportunities between B.C.’s tech and public sectors.
