I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need developers to help this project come to fruition.

You are invited to collaborate here in GitHub on the open development of an API specification.
  
Here at BC Assessment (BCA) we are exploring the potential of developing a new Application Programming Interface (API) that would provide access to BCAâ€™s property data. Developing an API in the open on GitHub is an opportunity for us to understand if such a service would be valuable.

Please read the [Discussion Guide](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/bc-property-api-specification/blob/master/BCA%20API%20Spec%20Develoment/README.md) for more information, including how you can participate in this project.  

## Swagger Definition
We have started with Swagger definition which you can find in the code directory.

## Usage
This development map fleshes out our thinking on how we could collaborate on the API spec, and potentially on code for the API too.

## Requirements
We may add some technical standards in the future.

## Project Status
Just started.

## Goals/Roadmap
You can find our project goals [here](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/bc-property-api-specification/blob/master/BCA%20API%20Spec%20Develoment/What-does-BCA-want-to-learn.md).

Right now we are focused on iterating a Swagger definition, Read this for more information [next steps](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/bc-property-api-specification/blob/master/BCA%20API%20Spec%20Develoment/Next-Steps.md).
## Asking Questions or Reporting an Issue
This project is all about collaborating on an API specification. We are devs interested in talking about technical stuff, so we will concentrate on what we are good at and leave the business decisions up to others. 

If you want to talk about non-technical considerations, feel free to post an issue. But we may not be able to respond to issues outside the technical scope of this project as that is not our team's expertise. Those issues will likely go into a parking lot for now.

Read this for more on what's in [scope](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/bc-property-api-specification/blob/master/BCA%20API%20Spec%20Develoment/Scope-and-Constraints.md).
