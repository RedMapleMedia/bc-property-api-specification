# What are the scope and constraints?

There are a few considerations:



- Business needs and business value will guide technical development, not the other way around.



- To allow for your innovative ideas we aren’t overly prescriptive about technologies. As we progress, we may add a few technology standards.



- As a publicly-funded Crown corporation, BCA is seeking to develop a business model that will be sustainable. Models may include subscription, freemium or pay as you go.  The purpose of any revenue generated will be to offset the costs of producing a high quality assessment roll for the British Columbia’s taxpayers. 



- The licensing provisions for this service will need to be consistent with and support the other products and services BCA has available in the market place. 



- We expect the specification to iterate. As it does, the technology scope may become clear as a result of the guidance from our collaborators.
