# How can I participate?

The collaboration will happen in two streams, one for entrepreneurs and businesses in the property market, the other for developers versed in the technical space of APIs. Some tech entrepreneurs may be interested in participating in both streams.

##Business Stream

We want potential customers in the property information market to help set business goals for this collaboration and an API service.  BCA is seeking to:



- Learn about the market and the needs of customers through discovery and experiments;
- Support the growth in the property information market.
- We want to hear innovative use cases and business models that will inform the design and monetization of an API service. Contact us here [propertyinfo@bcassessment.ca](mailto:propertyinfo@bcassessment.ca) for more information to get involved.

##Technical Stream

The technical stream will happen in GitHub in this repo. We want developers to help us set technical goals, including:



- Access requirements
- Data needs
- Service level expectations
- Other important stuff you can think of.

We started a repo in GitHub that contains skeleton Swagger file that uses Swagger editor. 
We like starting with a Swagger definition, because itâ€™s portable and code agnostic, but welcome your feedback in GitHub on this approach.

The Swagger definition is a straw dog to generate discussion. We want developers to kick that dog around, and let us know what they think. We also want them to get cracking on their own definitions using Swagger.
